Heart disease prediction system using machine learning 


Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on a set of medical attributes. By leveraging a dataset containing various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other vital parameters, we have built a predictive model that can assist in the early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

Usage
To utilize the heart disease prediction model, you can follow these steps:

Ensure that the required Python packages are installed.
Prepare your dataset in a CSV format with the necessary attributes.
Run the Heart_Desease_Prediction.pynb file by uploading the Heart.csv file.
Copy code
Heart_Desease_Prediction.pynb --dataset Heart.csv
The model will generate predictions for each instance in the dataset and display the results.

Features
Utilizes a machine learning algorithm trained on a comprehensive heart disease dataset.
Provides accurate predictions for the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided attributes.
Offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and interpretation of results.
In this, I used a random forest classification model and got an accuracy of 98.5% if anyone whats to build a new project I was open to work and sharing the information. For contributing follow the below steps.

Credits
This heart disease prediction model was developed by Greeshmanth Kumar. We would like to acknowledge the contributions of the Heart Disease Database for providing the training data.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Q: What attributes are included in the dataset?
A: The dataset contains attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

Q: How accurate is the prediction model?
A: The model achieves an accuracy of around 98.5% on our test dataset. However, accuracy may vary depending on the quality and size of the input data in our project we have used a random forest classifier for prediction the of heart disease.
